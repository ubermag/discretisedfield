## About

This Python package provides:

- Definition of finite difference meshes and fields
- Reading and writing of different file types, such as `.ovf`, `.vtk`, and `.hdf5`
- Visualisation of finite difference meshes and fields using `matplotlib` and `k3d`

It is available on all major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux) and requires Python 3.6 or higher.

## Installation, testing, and upgrade

We support installation using `conda` and `pip` package managers. Instructions can be found [here](https://discretisedfield.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ipynb/00-tutorial-installation-testing-upgrade.html).

## Binder

This package can be used in the cloud via Binder. This does not require you to have anything installed and no files will be created on your machine. To access Binder, use this [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ubermag/discretisedfield/master?urlpath=lab/tree/docs/ipynb/index.ipynb).

## Documentation
