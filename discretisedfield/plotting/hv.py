    """Holoviews-based plotting methods.

    Plots based on Holoviews can be created without prior slicing. Instead, a slider is
    created for the directions not shown in the plot. This class should not be accessed
    directly. Use ``field.hv`` to use the different plotting methods.

    Hv has a class property ``norm_filter`` that controls the default behaviour of
    ``Hv.__call__``, the convenience plotting method that is typically available as
    ``field.hv()``. By default ``norm_filter=True`` and plots created with ``hv()`` use
    automatic filtering based on the norm of the field. To disable automatic filtering
    globally use ``discretisedfield.plotting.defaults.norm_filter = False``.

        """Create an optimal plot combining ``hv.scalar`` and ``hv.vector``.

        This is a convenience method for quick plotting. It combines ``hv.scalar`` and
         ``hv.vector``. Depending on the dimensionality of the object, it automatically
         determines the typo of plot in the following order:

        1. For scalar objects (no dimension with name ``'comp'``) only
           ``discretisedfield.plotting.Hv.scalar`` is used.

        2. When ``vdims`` is specified a vector plot (without coloring) is created for
           the "in-plane" part of the vector field (defined via ``vdims``). If the field
           has vector dimensionality larger than two an additional scalar plot is
           created for all remaining vector components (with a drop-down selection).

        3. If the field is a 3d vector field and defined in 3d space the in-plane and
           out-of-plane vector components are determined (guessed) automatically. A
           scalar plot is created for the out-of-plane component and overlaied with a
           vector plot for the in-plane components (without coloring).

        4. For all other vector fields a scalar plot with a drop-down selection for the
           individual vector components is created.

        Based on the norm of the object (absolute values for scalar fields) automatic
        filtering is applied, i.e. all cells where the norm is zero are excluded from
        the plot. To manually filter out parts of the plot (e.g. areas where the norm of
        the field is zero) an additional ``roi`` can be passed. It can take an
        ``xarray.DataArray`` or a ``discretisedfield.Field`` and hides all points where
        ``roi`` is 0. It relies on ``xarray``s broadcasting and the object passed to
        ``roi`` must only have the same dimensions as the ones specified as ``kdims``.

        To disable filtering pass ``norm_filter=False``. To disable filtering for all
        plots globally set ``discretisedfield.plotting.defaults.norm_filter = False``.
        If norm filtering has been disabled globally use ``norm_filter=True`` to enable
        it for a single plot.

        All default values of ``hv.scalar`` and ``hv.vector`` can be changed by passing
        dictionaries to ``scalar_kw`` and ``vector_kw``, which are then used in
        subplots.

        To reduce the number of points in the plot a simple re-sampling is available.
        The parameter ``n`` in ``scalar_kw`` or ``vector_kw``. can be used to specify
        the number of points in different directions. A tuple of length 2 can be used to
        specify the number of points in the two ``kdims``. A dictionary can be used to
        specify the number of points in arbitrary dimensions. Keys of the dictionary
        must be dimensions of the array. Dimensions that are not specified are not
        modified. Note, that the re-sampling method is very basic and does not do any
        sort of interpolation (it just picks the nearest point). The extreme points in
        each direction are always kept. Equidistant points are picked in between. The
        same resampling has to be used for all slider dimensions.

        Therefore, to understand the meaning of the keyword arguments which can be
        passed to this method, please refer to
        ``discretisedfield.plotting.Hv.scalar`` and
        ``discretisedfield.plotting.Hv.vector`` documentation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        kdims : List[str]

            Array coordinates plotted in plot x and plot y direction.

        vdims : List[str], optional

            Names of the components to be used for the x and y component of the plotted
            arrows. This information is used to associate field components and spatial
            directions. Optionally, one of the list elements can be ``None`` if the
            field has no component in that direction. ``vdims`` is required for non-3d
            vector fields and for fields that do not have 3 spatial coordinates.

        roi : xarray.DataArray, discretisedfield.Field, optional

            Field to filter out certain areas in the plot. Only cells where the
            roi is non-zero are included in the output.

        norm_filtering : bool, optional

            If ``True`` use a default roi based on the norm of the field, if ``False``
            do not filter automatically. If not specified the value of
            ``discretisedfield.plotting.defaults.norm_filter`` is used. This allows
            globally disabling the filtering.

        scalar_kw : dict

            Additional keyword arguments that are
            ``discretisedfield.plotting.Hv.scalar``

        This method creates a dynamic holoviews plot (``holoviews.DynamicMap``) based on

        the norm of the in-plane component of the field. It is not necessary to create a

        ``vdims`` defines the components of the plotted object shown in the plot x and

        components and three spatial dimensions ``vdims`` can be omitted and the vector
        components and spatial directions are combined based on their order.

        For 3d vector fields the color by default encodes the out-of-plane component.
        Other fields cannot be colored automatically. To assign a non-uniform color
        manually use ``cdim``. It either accepts a string to select one of the field
        vector components or a scalar ``discretisedfield.Field`` or
        ``xarray.DataArray``. Coloring can be disabled with ``use_color``.

        To filter out parts of the plot (e.g. areas where the norm of the field is zero)
        an additional ``roi`` can be passed. It can take an ``xarray.DataArray`` or a

        Parameters
        ----------
        kdims : List[str]

            Array coordinates plotted in plot x and plot y direction.

        vdims : List[str], optional

            Names of the components to be used for the x and y component of the plotted
            arrows. This information is used to associate field components and spatial
            directions. Optionally, one of the list elements can be ``None`` if the
            field has no component in that direction. ``vdims`` is required for non-3d
            vector fields and for fields that do not have 3 spatial coordinates.

        cdim : str, xarray.DataArray, discretisedfield.Field, optional

            A string can be used to select one of the vector components of the field. To
            color according to different data scalar ``discretisedfield.Field`` or
            ``xarray.DataArray`` can be used to color the arrows. This option has no
            effect when ``use_color=False``. If not passed the out-of-plane component is
            used for 3d vector fields defined in 3d space. Otherwise, a warning is show
            and automatic coloring is disabled.

        roi : xarray.DataArray, discretisedfield.Field, optional

            Field to filter out certain areas in the plot. Only cells where the
            roi is non-zero are included in the output.

        n : array_like, dict, optional

            Re-sampling of the array with the given number of points. If an array-like
            is passed it must have length 2 and the values are used for the two kdims.
            If a dictionary is passed its keys must correspond to (some of) the
            dimensions of the array. If not specified no re-sampling is done.

        use_color : bool, optional

            If ``True`` the field is colored according to the out-of-plane component. If
            ``False`` all arrows have a uniform color, by default black. To change the
            uniform color pass e.g.``color= 'blue'``. Defaults to ``True``.

        colorbar_label : str, optional

            Label to show on the colorbar.

        kwargs

            Additional keyword arguments that are forwarded to
            ``holoviews.VectorField.opts()``.

        Returns
        -------
        holoviews.DynamicMap

            A ``holoviews.DynamicMap`` that "creates" a ``holoviews.Image`` for each

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError

        """Plot contour lines of scalar fields or vector components.

        This method creates a dynamic holoviews plot (``holoviews.DynamicMap``) based on
        ``holoviews.Contours``. The plot shows the plane defined with the two spatial
        directions passed to ``kdims``. If a vector field is passed (that means the
        field dimension is greater than 1) an additional ``panel.Select`` widget for the
        field components is created automatically. It is not necessary to create a
        cut-plane first.

        To filter out parts of the plot (e.g. areas where the norm of the field is zero)
        an additional ``roi`` can be passed. It can take an ``xarray.DataArray`` or a
        ``discretisedfield.Field`` and hides all points where ``roi`` is 0. It relies on
        ``xarray``s broadcasting and the object passed to ``roi`` must only have the
        same dimensions as the ones specified as ``kdims``. No automatic filtering is
        applied.

        To reduce the number of points in the plot a simple re-sampling is available.
        The parameter ``n`` can be used to specify the number of points in different
        directions. A tuple of length 2 can be used to specify the number of points in
        the two ``kdims``. A dictionary can be used to specify the number of points in
        arbitrary dimensions. Keys of the dictionary must be dimensions of the array.
        Dimensions that are not specified are not modified. Note, that the re-sampling
        method is very basic and does not do any sort of interpolation (it just picks
        the nearest point). The extreme points in each direction are always kept.
        Equidistant points are picked in between.

        Additional keyword arguments are directly forwarded to
         ``harray.hvplot.contour``. Please refer to the documentation of ``hvplot`` (and
         ``holoviews``) for available options and additional documentation on how to
         modify the plot after creation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        kdims : List[str]

            Array coordinates plotted in plot x and plot y direction.

        roi : xarray.DataArray, discretisedfield.Field, optional

            Field to filter out certain areas in the plot. Only cells where the
            roi is non-zero are included in the output.

        n : array_like, dict, optional

            Re-sampling of the array with the given number of points. If an array-like
            is passed it must have length 2 and the values are used for the two kdims.
            If a dictionary is passed its keys must correspond to (some of) the
            dimensions of the array. If not specified no re-sampling is done.

        kwargs

            Additional keyword arguments that are forwarded to
            ``xarray.hvplot.contour``.

        Returns
        -------
        holoviews.DynamicMap

            A ``holoviews.DynamicMap`` that "creates" a ``holoviews.Image`` for each
            slider value.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError

            If ``kdims`` has not length 2 or contains strings that are not part of the
            objects dimensions (``'x'``, ``'y'``, or ``'z'`` for standard
            discretisedfield.Field objects).

        Examples
        --------
        1. Simple contour-line plot with ``hv``.

        >>> import discretisedfield as df
        ...
        >>> p1 = (0, 0, 0)
        >>> p2 = (100, 100, 100)
