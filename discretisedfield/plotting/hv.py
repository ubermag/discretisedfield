class Hv:
    """Holoviews-based plotting methods.

    Plots based on Holoviews can be created without prior slicing. Instead, a slider is
    created for the directions not shown in the plot. This class should not be accessed
    directly. Use ``field.hv`` to use the different plotting methods.

    Hv has a class property ``norm_filter`` that controls the default behaviour of
    ``Hv.__call__``, the convenience plotting method that is typically available as
    ``field.hv()``. By default ``norm_filter=True`` and plots created with ``hv()`` use
    automatic filtering based on the norm of the field. To disable automatic filtering
    globally use ``discretisedfield.plotting.defaults.norm_filter = False``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    key_dims : dict[df.plotting.util.hv_key_dim]

        Key dimensions of the plot (kdims and dynamic kdims [for which holoviews will
        create widgets]) in a dictionary. The keys are the names of the dimensions,
        values namedtuples containing the data and unit (can be an empty string) of the
        dimensions.

    callback : callable

        Callback function to provide data. It must accept arbitrary keyword arguments
        and will be called with all dynamic kdims and their current values.

    vdims_guess_callback : callable, optional

       Callback function to provide (guess) vdims for the __call__ method if no vdims
       are passed in. This method is required because the order of key_dims is not
       defined.

        """Create an optimal plot combining ``hv.scalar`` and ``hv.vector``.

        This is a convenience method for quick plotting. It combines ``hv.scalar`` and
         ``hv.vector``. Depending on the dimensionality of the object, it automatically
         determines the type of plot in the following order:

        1. For scalar objects (no dimension with name ``'vdims'``) only
           ``discretisedfield.plotting.Hv.scalar`` is used. The parameter ``vdims`` is
           ignored.

        2. When ``vdims`` is specified a vector plot (without coloring) is created for
           the "in-plane" part of the vector field (defined via ``vdims``). If the field
           has vector dimensionality larger than two an additional scalar plot is
           created for all remaining vector components (with a drop-down selection).

        3. If ``vdims`` is not specified the method tries to guess the correct ``vdims``
           from the ``kdims`` by matching spatial coordinates and vector components
           based on the order they are defined in. This only works if both have the same
           number of elements, e.g. a 3d vector field in 3d space.

        4. For all other vector fields a scalar plot with a drop-down selection for the
           individual vector components is created.

        Based on the norm of the object (absolute values for scalar fields) automatic
        filtering is applied, i.e. all cells where the norm is zero are excluded from
        the plot. To manually filter out parts of the plot (e.g. areas where the norm of
        the field is zero) an additional ``roi`` can be passed. It can take an
        ``xarray.DataArray`` or a ``discretisedfield.Field`` and hides all points where
        ``roi`` is 0. It relies on ``xarray``s broadcasting and the object passed to
        ``roi`` must only have the same dimensions as the ones specified as ``kdims``.

        To disable filtering pass ``norm_filter=False``. To disable filtering for all
        plots globally set ``discretisedfield.plotting.defaults.norm_filter = False``.
        If norm filtering has been disabled globally use ``norm_filter=True`` to enable
        it for a single plot.

        All default values of ``hv.scalar`` and ``hv.vector`` can be changed by passing
        dictionaries to ``scalar_kw`` and ``vector_kw``, which are then used in
        subplots.
        To understand the meaning of the keyword arguments which can be passed to this
        method, please refer to ``discretisedfield.plotting.Hv.scalar`` and
        ``discretisedfield.plotting.Hv.vector`` documentation.

        To reduce the number of points in the plot a simple re-sampling is available.
        The parameter ``n`` in ``scalar_kw`` or ``vector_kw`` can be used to specify the
        number of points in different directions. A tuple of length 2 can be used to
        specify the number of points in the two ``kdims``. Note, that the re-sampling
        method is very basic and does not do any sort of interpolation (it just picks
        the nearest point). The extreme points in each direction are always kept.
        Equidistant points are picked in between.

        Parameters
        ----------
        kdims : List[str]

            Names of the two geometrical directions forming the plane to be used for
            plotting the data.

        vdims : List[str], optional

            Names of the components to be used for plotting the arrows. This information
            is used to associate field components and spatial directions. Optionally,
            one of the list elements can be ``None`` if the field has no component in
            that direction.

        roi : xarray.DataArray, discretisedfield.Field, optional

            Filter out certain areas in the plot. Only cells where the roi is non-zero
            are included in the output.

        norm_filter : bool, optional

            If ``True`` use a default roi based on the norm of the field, if ``False``
            do not filter automatically. If not specified the value of
            ``discretisedfield.plotting.defaults.norm_filter`` is used. This allows
            globally disabling the filtering.

        scalar_kw : dict

            Additional keyword arguments that are passed to
            ``discretisedfield.plotting.Hv.scalar``

        Parameters
        ----------
        kdims : List[str]

            Names of the two geometrical directions forming the plane to be used for
            plotting the data.

        vdims : List[str], optional

            Names of the components to be used for plotting the arrows. This information
            is used to associate field components and spatial directions. Optionally,
            one of the list elements can be ``None`` if the field has no component in
            that direction. If ``vdims`` is not specified the method tries to guess the
            correct ``vdims`` from the ``kdims`` by matching spatial coordinates and
            vector components based on the order they are defined in. This only works if
            both have the same number of elements, e.g. a 3d vector field in 3d space.

        cdim : str, xarray.DataArray, discretisedfield.Field, optional

            A string can be used to select one of the vector components of the field. To
            color according to different data scalar ``discretisedfield.Field`` or
            ``xarray.DataArray`` can be used to color the arrows. This option has no
            effect when ``use_color=False``. If not passed the out-of-plane component is
            used for 3d vector fields. Otherwise, a warning is show and automatic
            coloring is disabled.

        roi : xarray.DataArray, discretisedfield.Field, optional

            Field to filter out certain areas in the plot. Only cells where the
            roi is non-zero are included in the output.

        n : array_like, optional

            Re-sampling of the array with the given number of points. If not specified
            no re-sampling is done.

        use_color : bool, optional

            If ``True`` the field is colored according to the out-of-plane component. If
            ``False`` all arrows have a uniform color, by default black. To change the
            uniform color pass e.g.``color= 'blue'``. Defaults to ``True``.

        kwargs

            Additional keyword arguments that are forwarded to
            ``holoviews.VectorField.opts()``.

        Returns
        -------
        holoviews.DynamicMap

            A ``holoviews.DynamicMap`` that "creates" a ``holoviews.VectorField`` for
            each slider value.

        Raises
        ------

        """Plot contour lines of scalar fields or vector components.

        This method creates a dynamic holoviews plot (``holoviews.DynamicMap``) based on
        ``holoviews.Contours``. The plot shows the plane defined with the two spatial
        directions passed to ``kdims``. If a vector field is passed (that means the
        field dimension is greater than 1) an additional ``panel.Select`` widget for the
        field components is created automatically. It is not necessary to create a
        cut-plane first.

        To filter out parts of the plot (e.g. areas where the norm of the field is zero)
        an additional ``roi`` can be passed. It can take an ``xarray.DataArray`` or a
        ``discretisedfield.Field`` and hides all points where ``roi`` is 0. It relies on
        ``xarray``s broadcasting and the object passed to ``roi`` must only have the
        same dimensions as the ones specified as ``kdims``. No automatic filtering is
        applied.

        To reduce the number of points in the plot a simple re-sampling is available.
        The parameter ``n`` can be used to specify the number of points in different
        directions. A tuple of length 2 can be used to specify the number of points in
        the two ``kdims``. Note, that the re-sampling method is very basic and does not
        do any sort of interpolation (it just picks the nearest point). The extreme
        points in each direction are always kept. Equidistant points are picked in
        between.

        Additional keyword arguments are directly forwarded to the ``.opts`` method of
         the ``holoviews.DynamicMap``. Please refer to the documentation of
         ``holoviews`` (in particular `holoviews.Contours``) for available options and
         additional documentation on how to modify the plot after creation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        kdims : List[str]

            Names of the two geometrical directions forming the plane to be used for
            plotting the data.

        roi : xarray.DataArray, discretisedfield.Field, optional

            Field to filter out certain areas in the plot. Only cells where the
            roi is non-zero are included in the output.

        n : array_like(2), optional

            Re-sampling of the array with the given number of points. If an array-like
            is passed it must have length 2 and the values are used for the two kdims.
            If not specified no re-sampling is done.

        levels : int, optional

            The number of contour lines, defaults to 10.

        kwargs

            Additional keyword arguments that are forwarded to ``.opts`` of the
            ``holoviews.DynamicMap`` object.

        Returns
        -------
        holoviews.DynamicMap

            A ``holoviews.DynamicMap`` that "creates" a ``holoviews.Contours`` object
            for each slider value.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError

            If ``kdims`` has not length 2 or contains strings that are not part of the
            geometrical directions of the field.

        Examples
        --------
        1. Simple contour-line plot with ``hv``.

        ...
        >>> p1 = (0, 0, 0)
